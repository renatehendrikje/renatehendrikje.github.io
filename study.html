	<h2>How I Learn Frontend</h2>
	<div class="columns">
		<p class="intro">When I was first thinking about becoming a frontend programmer, I did not know how to approach it. I did not want to be in an official schooling environment anymore. Too expensive, too long and also not up to date enough. I heard some inspiring stories from people who learned programming on their own, and came up with the below learning path.</p>
		<h3>Treehouse</h3>
		<p>I've used the <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> learning adventure 'Become a Web Designer' as a guide to learn frontend programming. This online school was a good way to start for me, because they assume you have no knowledge at all about making websites. There is a good oversight of the steps you need to take, and a good following order. You watch instruction videos and make exersises. The coding exersises are made and checked in the browser.<br /> I've worked on subjects like: basic making and launching of a website, HTML, CSS 2.1, CSS 3, Photoshop, JavaScript, Responsiveness, Ruby on Rails, working with the terminal, working with version control on GitHub. </p>

		<h3>RailsGirls</h3>
		<p><a href="http://railsgirls.com">RailsGirls</a> is an international organization trying to get more girls into programming. The first time I ever tried out programming was at a RailsGirls event in Amsterdam. Since then I've been to a few follow-up meetings organized by <a href="http://railsgirls.nl">RailsGirls NL</a>. There are always volunteers to help with the coding, and it's very accessible and a lot of fun. It's been great to see how many girls are interested in learning how to code.</p>

		<h3>Fronteers</h3>
		<p>When I quit my job to seriously pursue becoming a frontender, I decided to subscribe as a member of <a href="http://fronteers.nl">Fronteers</a>. It is the largest community of frontenders in the Netherlands, and the meetings and talks that are organised are a great source of information. Also, going to the meetings is a good way to meet fellow frontenders.</p>

		<h3>Asking my Boyfriend</h3>
		<p>My boyfriend, Thijs Cadier, is a backend programmer and owner of an Amsterdam based web development company, <a href="http://www.80beans.com">80Beans</a>, together with his business partner, Roy Tomeij. Through him I got familiar with web development and the 'programmers culture'. Looking over their shoulders I was inspired to get into programming, and the frontend side of it appealed to me the most. One day I hope to become half as good at it as Roy.</p>

		<h3>Workshops</h3>
		<p>The first workshop I've attended was from RailsGirls. This workshop was designed to let people with no previous experience in programming build a Ruby on Rails app in one day. A great way to get a taste, and inspiring to learn more. Another workshop I attended was on working with Git and GitHub, by Peter Robinett of <a href="http://www.bubblefoundry.com">Bubble Foundry</a>. A good start into working with version control. Furthermore, I attended a workshop "Guru Session: Programming for Beginners" by Matteo Manferdini at <a href="http://appsterdam.rs">Appsterdam</a>. A bit challenging still for me at that time, though I learned a lot. And as a last one, not actually a workshop but more of a try-out, a learning session with Roy Tomeij (<a href="http://www.80beans.com">80Beans</a>) on frontend programming. We went through the basic steps from receiving your design to delivering a working and beautiful site. Really helpful for me, it was a confirmation that this is what I would like to be working on.</p>

		<h3>Books</h3>
		<p>I did not use a great deal of books, I often rather just use Google and Stack Overflow to solve any issues I stumble upon. Also, I made good notes of all the lessons I did at Treehouse (see above), so for reference I often just read those. A classic which I found helpful, especially for deciding what NOT to put on the home page, is "Don't Make Me Think!" by Steve Krug. Also good reads are "Javascript: The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford and "HTML &amp; CSS: The Good Parts" by Ben Henick.</p>
