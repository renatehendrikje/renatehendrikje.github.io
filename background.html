<p>Before diving into the Frontend programming adventure, I've spent some years in art school (WDK in Rotterdam, autonomous art). Also, I've completed a bachelors and masters degree in Slavic Languages and Cultures (Leiden University). I majored in Russian Linguistics, and graduated with honors.<br /> After graduation I worked for a year at NetApp BV, an international company selling data storage hardware, software and support. I worked in the order administration department, as an order reviewer. (References available upon request.) In December 2012 I quit my job as an order reviewer, to devote my time to learning Frontend coding.</p>
