		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>After finishing my VWO (pre-university education), I spent two years working, in the Netherlands and at a kibbutz in Israel. I was not sure yet what I wanted to study, and decided to see something of the world first.<br />In 2001 I started studying Autonomous Art at Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam (University of Applied Sciences). There I made mostly 3D work, and learned techniques like welding, working with polyester, ceramics, sewing, painting and etching. I loved working with metal and electrotechnics. I felt at the right place at first, but after the third year I decided to stop. The study became to 'free' for me, when there were no more assignments and we were just working on our own. I looked into studies in the direction of another of my passions: languages.<br />In 2005 I started the bachelor study Slavic Languages and cultures at the University of Leiden. I learned Russian, and studied Russian linguistics, literature, history, law and economics. Also, I did a minor 'Didactics of Dutch as a Second Language'. The bachelor phase included a three month period at Saint Petersburg State University, in Russia. In 2009 I started the master study Slavic Languages and Cultures. My main subject was Russian linguistics, with a focus on semantics and syntax. In 2011 I graduated with honours. After working for a year, I saved up enough to make yet one more career change, studying <a href="/study.html">frontend programming</a>. In this I can combine my passion for language and creative work.</p>
		<h3>Work History</h3>
		<p>My most recent job was working as an Order Review Specialist at NetApp BV, an international company selling data storage hardware, software and service. In my function I checked Russian and Dutch sales orders, and managed the resolution of all possible problems occurring after sales.<br />Before this, during university, I worked as a teacher in Dutch language. I had three jobs in this direction, as an intern, as a teachers assistant and as voluntary work. Even further back, from 2004 to 2007, I worked at De Slegte bookstore in Rotterdam, selling and buying second hand books.</p>
