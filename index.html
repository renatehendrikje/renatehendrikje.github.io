	<h1>Looking For an Internship</h1>
	<h2>What</h2>
	<p>I'm looking for an internship as a (very) junior frontend developer at a company in web development. This company should have at least one but preferably several frontend developers.</p>
	<h2>Where</h2>
	<p>Amsterdam and surroundings.</p>
	<h2>When</h2>
	<p>Preferably for a period of 2-3 months, but this is negotiable. I would be available to start right about now. Fulltime or parttime are both possible.</p>
	<h2>How</h2>
	<p>I would expect to start with working on some old projects and trying to recreate them, as I do not have much practical experience in frontend programming yet. From time to time I would be sitting down with an experienced frontender, to discuss the work. Also, receiving some advice on what subjects to study some more on would be great. In time I could do some easy 'real' work and build from there to become a profitable intern for your company. If you have any other ideas on how to approach this, I am very interested to hear them.</p>
	<h2>Why</h2>
	<p>I've now spent some months learning on my own. I feel I have learned a lot, but there is still so much more to learn. It now becomes more difficult to choose in what direction to go with learning, and I think it is time for me to get a taste of 'the real world' to figure out what's the most important at this point. Also, it would be great to be able to contribute to something else than my own education, and to work together in a team.</p>

	<h1>Background and References</h1>
	<p>Before diving into the Frontend programming adventure, I've spent some years in art school (WDK in Rotterdam, autonomous art) and completed a bachelors and masters degree in Slavic Languages and Cultures (Leiden University). I majored in Russian Linguistics, and graduated with honors. As a reference for Russian linguistics, best would be to contact the professor guiding me on my thesis: Dr. Egbert Fortuin (E.Fortuin@hum.leidenuniv.nl).<br> After graduation I worked for a year at NetApp BV, an international company selling data storage hardware, software and support. I worked in the order administration department, as an order reviewer. This meant checking orders for bookings policy compliancy, and managing the resolution of all possible problems with the orders occurring after sales. As references for this period, it's best to contact my managers, Anna Moisio (Anna.Moisio@netapp.com) or Maksym Stebelev (Maksym.Stebelev@netapp.com). Please address both in English. In December 2012 I quit my job as an order reviewer, to devote my time to learning Frontend coding.</p>
