	<h2>Looking for an Internship</h2>
	<div class=" columns columns_internship">
		<h3>My Ideal Company</h3>
		<p>I'm looking for an internship or traineeship as a (very) junior frontend developer at a company in web development. This company should have at least one but preferably several other frontend developers.</p>
		<h3>Amsterdam</h3>
		<p>The best location for me would be in Amsterdam and surroundings.</p>
		<h3>3 Months, Starting Now!</h3>
		<p>The internship would preferably be for a period of about 3 months, but this is negotiable. I would be available to start right about now. Fulltime or parttime are both possible.</p>
		<h3>My ideas</h3>
		<p>I could start with trying to recreate some old projects, as I do not have much practical experience in frontend programming yet. From time to time I would be sitting down with an experienced frontender, to discuss the work. In time I could do some easy 'real' work and build from there to become a profitable intern for your company. If you have different ideas, I am very interested to hear them.</p>
		<h3>Ready For the Next Step</h3>
		<p>I've now spent some months learning on my own. It now becomes more difficult to choose in what direction to go with learning, and I think it is time for me to get a taste of 'the real world'. Also, it would be great to work together with other developers in a team, and to be able to contribute to something else besides my own education.</p><br />

	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Before diving into the Frontend programming adventure, I've spent some years in art school. Also, I've completed a bachelors and masters degree in Slavic Languages and Cultures. After graduation, I worked as an order reviewer at NetApp BV. In December 2012 I quit my job to devote my time to learning Frontend coding.</p>
