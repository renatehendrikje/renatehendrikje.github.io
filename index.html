	<h2>Looking For an Internship</h2>
	<h3>What</h3>
	<p>I'm looking for an internship as a (very) junior frontend developer at a company in web development. This company should have at least one but preferably several other frontend developers.</p>
	<h3>Where</h3>
	<p>Amsterdam and surroundings.</p>
	<h3>When</h3>
	<p>Preferably for a period of 2-3 months, but this is negotiable. I would be available to start right about now. Fulltime or parttime are both possible.</p>
	<h3>How</h3>
	<p>I could start with trying to recreate some old projects, as I do not have much practical experience in frontend programming yet. From time to time I would be sitting down with an experienced frontender, to discuss the work. In time I could do some easy 'real' work and build from there to become a profitable intern for your company. If you have different ideas, I am very interested to hear them.</p>
	<h3>Why</h3>
	<p>I've now spent some months learning on my own. It now becomes more difficult to choose in what direction to go with learning, and I think it is time for me to get a taste of 'the real world'. Also, it would be great to work together with other developers in a team, and to be able to contribute to something else besides my own education.</p>

	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Before diving into the Frontend programming adventure, I've spent some years in art school. Also, I've completed a bachelors and masters degree in Slavic Languages and Cultures.<br /> After graduation, I worked as an order reviewer at NetApp BV. In December 2012 I quit my job to devote my time to learning Frontend coding.<br /><a href="/background.html">Read more</a></p>
